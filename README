Homework Assignment for my CS:4640 Computer Security class at UIowa.

Implement two encryption algorithms out of the three possible choices:
    -Vigenere cipher*
    -Permutation cipher*
    -Simple Enigma machine with one rotor

* = one of my choices

Also must add a pre-processing step that removes non-alphabetic characters 
and spaces.  Then a second version of pre-processing that also removes spaces.

See Assignment_1.pdf for more specific details.
